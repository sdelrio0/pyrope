Pyrope is a Node.js promise-based ORM for GraphQL and AWS DynamoDB.

**Under development. Not intended for production use. Watch on [github](https://github.com/sdelrio0/pyrope) to be notified about new releases. Coming soon.**

Introduction
============
This project came into being in response to a lack of solutions for handling AWS DynamoDB through GraphQL, specifically in a [Serverless](http://serverless.com) architecture.
 
Use your existing GraphQL types and perform CRUD operations, as well as 1:1, 1:N, N:N associations.

Features
========
* Handle CRUD operations on records
* Handle 1:1, 1:N, N:N relationships
* Handle record counters

Getting Started
===============
```
$ npm install --save pyrope
```

```
const User = new PyropeModel(UserType);
```

Where UserType is a **GraphQLObjectType**.

Use the PyropeModel instance in your resolvers in order to perform Queries and Mutations.

Documentation
=============
Check the ES6Docs [here](https://doc.esdoc.org/github.com/sdelrio0/pyrope), the [API](https://doc.esdoc.org/github.com/sdelrio0/pyrope/class/lib/models.js~PyropeModel.html) and the [tests](https://github.com/sdelrio0/pyrope/tree/master/__tests__).

More to come...
 
Specifications
==============
* Table names are generated by Inflector.tableize(modelName) from [Inflected](https://github.com/martinandert/inflected).
* The default index key for each record is **uuid**
* The association table name is generated by concatenating both table names with an underscore, in alphabetical order. ie, contacts_orgnaizations.
* If `NODE_ENV='test'` the table names are prefixed with `_test_`
* The record counts are stored in `table_counters` table.

TODOs
=====
- [ ] Query optimizations
- [ ] Stress tests and look for data inconsistencies (ie. failed requests)
- [ ] Optimize algorithms for associations
- [ ] Production testing
